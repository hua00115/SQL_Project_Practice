## Purpose

This repository helps me:

- Practice and reinforce SQL concepts.
- Solve real-world data querying problems.
- Prepare for daily uses in a data analyst roles.

## Sample Results and Query

Q1: COMPANY WITH MAXIMUM LAIDOFF EMPLOYEES AND MAXIMUM LAIDOFF PERCENTAGE

Query:
SELECT MAX(total_laid_off), MIN(percentage_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_duplicate
;

Result:

Q2: COMPANY WITH PERCENTAGE LAYOFF OF 100%, WITH DESCENDING ORDER IN FUNDS RAISED

SELECT company, percentage_laid_off,funds_raised_millions
FROM layoffs_duplicate
WHERE percentage_laid_off =1
ORDER BY funds_raised_millions DESC
;

Result:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6daa777f-f3c0-4e74-a0dd-f3e41c68542b)


Q3: SHOWS THE COMPANY WITH THEIR TOTAL LAID OFF FROM ALL DATES, WITH DESCENDING ORDER NUMBER OF PEPS. - GRPUP BY AND SUM()

SELECT company,  SUM(total_laid_off) AS TOTAL_PEPS
FROM layoffs_duplicate
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY TOTAL_PEPS DESC
;

Result:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1631636-977f-43f8-baa4-ce6e02878418)


Q4: SHOWS THE NUMBER OF TOTAL LAID OFF IN EACH YEAR
SELECT YEAR( date ), SUM(total_laid_off)    # WE CAN SPECIFY YEAR INFRT OF (DATE)
FROM layoffs_duplicate
GROUP BY YEAR( date )
ORDER BY 1 DESC;

Result:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efc31735-5a50-46f5-9231-46e543bef8c9)


Q5: SHOWS THE NUMBER OF TOTAL LAID OFF IN EACH MONTH FOR DIFFERENT YEAR  - SUBSTRING TO SLICE
SELECT SUBSTRING( date ,1,7) AS MONTH, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_duplicate
WHERE SUBSTRING( date ,1,7) IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY MONTH
ORDER BY 1 ASC
;

Result:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fe45f92-59f6-4575-92d6-ad4736094a19)


Q6: ROLLING TOTAL THAT SLOWLY ADDED UP ALONG THE DATE !!! IMPORTANT
WITH Rolling_Total AS (
SELECT SUBSTRING( date ,1,7) AS MONTH, SUM(total_laid_off) AS total_off
FROM layoffs_duplicate
WHERE SUBSTRING( date,1,7) IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY MONTH
ORDER BY 1 ASC
)
SELECT MONTH,total_off, SUM(total_off) OVER(ORDER BY MONTH ) AS ro11
FROM Rolling_Total;

Result:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d326348-e0a3-42f0-85d6-ce40f1dd78d8)


Q7: Show me the total layoff-sum from each company in each year, and order by company name - do it in CTE
WITH Company_Year (company, years, total_laid_off) AS
(
SELECT company, YEAR( date), sum(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_duplicate
GROUP BY company, YEAR( date)
), Company_Year_Rank AS (SELECT *,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY years ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC) AS Ranking
FROM Company_Year
WHERE years IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT *
FROM Company_Year_Rank
WHERE Ranking<=5
;

Result:

## User Guide:

If you want to run the SQL files:

1. Set up a local SQL database using MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or any other RDBMS.
2. Import the SQL files into your SQL IDE.
3. Execute the script and enjoy the result.

## Notes

- The scripts are written primarily for practice and learning purposes.
- Naming conventions and formatting may vary as I explore different styles.
- Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!



Thank You!
